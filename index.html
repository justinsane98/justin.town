<h1>I'm NOT just in town<span class="tm">tm</span></h1>
<p>I’m Justin Shearer, a nomadic freelance designer/developer living on the road with my family in our <a href="http://www.tinysheel.house">tiny house on wheels</a>.</p>
<p>As a former frontend-developer at <a href="http://www.squareup.com">Square</a> and <a href="http://www.giftly.com">Giftly</a> in San Francisco, CA and web-designer at <a href="http://www.vc3.com">VC3</a> and <a href="http://www.graysail.com">GraySail</a> in Columbia, SC, I know what it’s like to deliver polished products from coast to coast. I’ve worked as a lone designer/developer and as a part of a large team spread across the globe working on anything from one-off marketing websites to their core web products.</p>
<p>So don’t settle for someone who just so happens to be in town, work with someone who has over 15 years of industry experience and will give your product their undivided attention.</p>
